# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hello to all! This is my first repository on GitHub!
I have almost none programming skills (outside of Scratch), so I'm interested on learning any of the programming languages.
I had listened of a very few programming languages, only C++, Python and Java.

W.I.P.
